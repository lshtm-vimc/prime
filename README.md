# PRIME

PRIME stands for “Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics”.

PRIME is a tool, designed to give users an idea of:
- The magnitude of the burden of cervical cancer
- The impact of introducing HPV vaccination for girls prior to sexual debut
- Healthcare costs incurred as a result of cervical cancer treatment
- Costs associated with vaccination
- Long-term savings which may result from a vaccination program

*prime* is the R package version of the spreadsheet-based tool (accessible at http://primetool.org).
