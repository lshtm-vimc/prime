\arguments{
\item{countries}{ignore, read from .data.batch}

\item{coverage}{ignore, read from .data.batch}

\item{agevac}{ignore, read from .data.batch}

\item{agecohort}{ignore, read from .data.batch}

\item{canc.inc}{year from where incidence data is read (2018; old data: 2008/2012) -- with updated 2018 Globocan data, DALY weights from GBD, and DALY estimation based on prevalence instead of age of incidence, only 2018 is valid and 2008/2012 is not sensible}

\item{daly.canc.diag}{disability weight of diagnosis and primary therapy phase of cervical cancer}

\item{daly.canc.control}{Number: daly-weight for controlled phase of cervical cancer}

\item{daly.canc.metastatic}{Number: daly-weight for metastatic phase of cervical cancer}

\item{daly.canc.terminal}{disability weight of terminal phase of cervical cancer}

\item{sens}{ignore, doesnâ€™t do anything anymore}

\item{unwpp_mortality}{logical, whether to create lifetables based on UNWPP mx estimates or WHO data}

\item{year_born}{ignore}

\item{year_vac}{ignore}

\item{runs}{ignore}

\item{vaccine_efficacy_beforesexdebut}{vaccine efficacy before sexual debut}

\item{vaccine_efficacy_aftersexdebut}{vaccine efficacy after sexual debut}

\item{log}{name of log file}

\item{by_calendaryear}{logical, output values by calendar year or by year of birth cohort}

\item{use_proportions}{logical, output data as rates per capita or in totals}

\item{analyseCosts}{logical, directly run cost-effectiveness analysis on output or not}

\item{psa}{integer, number of runs for probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA)}

\item{psa_vals}{data table with values to use in probabilistic sensitivity analysis, usually .data.batch.psa, generated by RegisterBatchData* functions (currently only RegisterBatchdataGavi)}
